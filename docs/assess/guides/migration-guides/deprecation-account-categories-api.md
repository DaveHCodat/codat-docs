## Instructions for migration

Identify the endpoints you are using today and the alternative solutions available to you:

| Current endpoint 	| Alternative 	|
|---|---|
| [List account categories](/assess-api#/operations/list-available-account-categories) 	| The supported categories have changed - you can find the latest list [here](/assess/enhanced-financials/supported-account-categories).  	|
| [List suggested and confirmed account categories](/assess-api#/operations/list-accounts-categories)  <br/><br/> [Get suggested and/or confirmed categories for a specific account](/assess-api#/operations/get-account-category)  	| We will not be replicating this functionality in the latest version as itâ€™s possible for an account to have more than one category depending on the financial period.<br/>For example, a bank account could have a positive balance in one period and be categorized as an Asset, and a negative balance due to it being overdrawn in another and therefore categorized as a Liability. <br/>You can retrieve the categories per account and financial period via the these endpoints:<br/>[Enhanced profit and loss accounts](/assess-api#/operations/get-accounts-for-enhanced-profit-and-loss) <br/>[Enhanced balance sheet accounts](/assess-api#/operations/get-accounts-for-enhanced-balance-sheet) 	|
| [Confirm categories for accounts](/assess-api#/operations/update-accounts-categories) <br/><br/> [Confirm account category for a specific account](/assess-api#/operations/update-account-category)  	| You may want to recategorize accounts so that the model learns and improves for your companies. To do so:<br/>1. Log into the Codat portal <br/>2. Select a company on the **Companies** page <br/>3. Click the **Categorize Accounts** button <br/>4. Ensure the **Version** drop-down on the top right is set to _Version 3_ <br/>We have revamped this screen and included new features that simplify account categorization, including Confidence level. <br/><br/> If you used to recategorize because the Enhanced Profit and Loss / Balance Sheet was not being returned due to uncategorized accounts, note that the latest endpoints do not have this restriction. <br/>If you do not need the model to learn for your companies, you do not need to recategorize via Codat and can make amendments in your own environment. <br/><br/>**Note**: In the latest version we no longer support recategorization via API. 	|
| [Enhanced Profit and Loss](/assess-api#/operations/get-enhanced-profit-and-loss)  	| [Enhanced profit and loss accounts](/assess-api#/operations/get-accounts-for-enhanced-profit-and-loss) <br/>Note: the response schema has changed. 	|
| [Enhanced Balance sheet](/assess-api#/operations/get-enhanced-balance-sheet)  	| [Enhanced balance sheet accounts](/assess-api#/operations/get-accounts-for-enhanced-balance-sheet) <br/>Note: the response schema has changed. 	|
| [List financial metrics](/assess-api#/operations/get-enhanced-financial-metrics) <br/><br/> [Get the marketing metrics from an accounting source](/assess-api#/operations/get-accounting-marketing-metrics) 	| We are no longer supporting the precalculated metrics available on these endpoints. You can calculate these using your own formulas from our new endpoints: <br/>[Enhanced profit and loss accounts](/assess-api#/operations/get-accounts-for-enhanced-profit-and-loss) <br/>[Enhanced balance sheet accounts](/assess-api#/operations/get-accounts-for-enhanced-balance-sheet) <br/><br/>If you would like to continue using the same formulas for the precalculated metrics we offered, you can find the formulas [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xpyQHOTQWHybOZpSnfXx54tkag0qmJ1mR76bQt9wink/edit?usp=sharing)  	|
