- [GET /data/companies/{companyId}/connections/{connectionId}/assess/accounts/{accountId}/categories](/assess-api#/operations/get-account-category)
- [PATCH /data/companies/{companyId}/connections/{connectionId}/assess/accounts/categories](/assess-api#/operations/update-accounts-categories)
- [PATCH /data/companies/{companyId}/connections/{connectionId}/assess/accounts/{accountId}/categories](/assess-api#/operations/update-account-category)

## Instructions for migration

Identify the endpoints you are using today and the alternative solutions available to you:

| Current endpoint 	| Alternative 	|
|---|---|
| GET /data/assess/accounts/categories 	| The supported categories have changed - you can find the latest list here.  	|
| GET /data/companies/{companyId}/connections/{connectionId}/assess/accounts/categories; and GET /data/companies/{companyId}/connections/{connectionId}/assess/accounts/{accountId}/categories 	| We will not be replicating this functionality in the latest version as itâ€™s possible for an account to have more than one category depending on the financial period e.g. a bank account could have a positive balance in one financial period and be categorized as an Asset and a negative balance due to it being overdrawn in another period and therefore categorized as a Liability. You can retrieve the categories per account and financial period via the these endpoints: [GET /companies/{companyId}/data/financials/profitAndLoss/accounts](/assess-api#/operations/get-accounts-for-enhanced-profit-and-loss) [GET /companies/{companyId}/data/financials/balanceSheet/accounts](/assess-api#/operations/get-accounts-for-enhanced-balance-sheet) 	|
| PATCH /data/companies/{companyId}/connections/{connectionId}/assess/accounts/categories; and PATCH /data/companies/{companyId}/connections/{connectionId}/assess/accounts/{accountId}/categories 	| If you want to recategorize accounts so the model learns and improves for your companies: Log into the Codat portal Select a company on the Companies page Click Categorize Accounts button Ensure the Version drop down on the top right is set to Version 3 We have revamped this screen including some new features which make it easier to categorize accounts including Confidence level. Note: We are no longer supporting recategorization via API in the latest version. If you are recategorizing accounts because the Enhanced Profit and Loss / Balance Sheet was not being returned due to uncategorized accounts: The latest endpoints does not have this restriction. If you do not care about the model learning for your companies, you do not need to recategorize via Codat and can make amendments in your own environment. 	|
| GET /data/companies{companyId}/connections/{connectionId}/assess/enhancedBalanceSheet 	| [GET /companies/{companyId}/data/financials/balanceSheet/accounts](/assess-api#/operations/get-accounts-for-enhanced-balance-sheet) Note: the response schema has changed. 	|
| GET /data/companies{companyId}/connections/{connectionId}/assess/enhancedProfitandLoss 	| [GET /companies/{companyId}/data/financials/profitAndLoss/accounts](/assess-api#/operations/get-accounts-for-enhanced-profit-and-loss) Note: the response schema has changed. 	|
| GET /data/companies/{companyId}/connections/{connectionId}/assess/financialMetrics; and GET /data/companies/{companyId}/connections/{connectionId}/assess/accountingMetrics/marketing 	| We are no longer supporting the precalculated metrics available on this endpoint. You can calculate these using your own formulas from our new endpoints: [GET /companies/{companyId}/data/financials/profitAndLoss/accounts](/assess-api#/operations/get-accounts-for-enhanced-profit-and-loss) [GET /companies/{companyId}/data/financials/balanceSheet/accounts](/assess-api#/operations/get-accounts-for-enhanced-balance-sheet) If you would like to continue using the same formulas for the precalculated metrics we offered, you can find the formulas [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xpyQHOTQWHybOZpSnfXx54tkag0qmJ1mR76bQt9wink/edit?usp=sharing)  	|
