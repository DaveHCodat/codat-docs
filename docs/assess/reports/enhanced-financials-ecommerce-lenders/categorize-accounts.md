:::caution Account category versions
The categories outlined here will not be returned by the older [Enhanced Balance Sheet](/assess/reports/enhanced-financials/balance-sheet) and [Enhanced Profit and Loss](/assess/reports/enhanced-financials/profit-and-loss) endpoints. They use an [older version](https://docs.codat.io/docs/assess-categories) of the account category taxonomy.
:::

With Enhanced Financials for eCommerce Lenders, Codat automatically suggests a category for each account that appears in the enhanced Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet. 

If you disagree with the suggested category, you can change it to a more suitable one. This only impacts the category field in Assess and does not lead to any changes in the underlying accounting platform.

You can view all available categories proposed for accounts and, where relevant, recategorize them in the <a href="https://app.codat.io/" target="_blank">Codat Portal</a>. 

1. Navigate to **Companies**, then click the company that requires categorization review. Select **Products > Assess** in the side menu. Finally, click **Categorize accounts**.

2. On the **Account Categorization** page, use the **Categories version** selector to choose version 3. This version represents the revised account categorization that Codat created for the eCommerce lending use case. 

   Here, you can view the categories automatically proposed for various accounts.

3. To change the category of an account, select the account using the tickbox and click **Recategorize**. 

   Choose an appropriate category from the proposed five levels and click **Recategorize**. This saves the newly assigned category. 

   Once saved, the account moves to the **Confirmed accounts** tab. You can also perform recategorization there.

That's it! The Enhanced Profit and Loss and Enhanced Balance Sheet for eCommerce lenders will return the updated category for the accounts going forward.
