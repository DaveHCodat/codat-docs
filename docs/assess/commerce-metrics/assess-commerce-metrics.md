:::caution Supported platforms

We will only produce metrics for the platforms that support the following data types:

- Commerce - Company Info
- Commerce - Customers
- Commerce - Orders
  :::

This feature provides a set of pre-calculated ratios and metrics focussed on commerce/sales data to assess merchant health. It exposes some of the key insights lenders need to assess the credit risk of a company using commerce data. _Commerce Metrics_ provides the data that lets you see what works and what doesn't, providing the opportunity to advise your customers / prospects on what they can do to improve their performance.
