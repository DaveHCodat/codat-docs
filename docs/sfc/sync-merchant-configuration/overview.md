After the merchant selects the accounting platform they wish to pull the accounting data from, they can move on to the merchant configuration stage, at which they authorize Codat to process their accounting data and configure the data mapping between their commerce and accounting platforms. There are two ways to enable them to do that:

1. Continue [building your own merchant journey](https://docs.codat.io/docs/sync-your-own-merchant-journey) using our Sync Configuration endpoints for a truly seamless experience for your merchants.
2. Use [Codatâ€™s white-labeled no-code merchant configuration flow](https://docs.codat.io/docs/implementing-codats-no-code-merchant-configuration) for accelerated speed-to-market.
