- **Account balances** - a list of balances for a bank account including end-of-day batch balance or running balances per transaction.
- **Transactions** - a list of transactions incurred by the bank account.
- **Transaction categories** - a list of hierarchical categories associated with a transaction for greater contextual meaning to transaction activity.
