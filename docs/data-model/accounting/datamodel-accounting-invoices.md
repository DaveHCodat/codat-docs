## Overview

An invoice is an itemized record of goods sold or services provided to a [customer](/datamodel-accounting-customers).

In Codat, an invoice contains details of:

- The timeline of the invoiceâ€”when it was raised, marked as paid, last edited, and so on.
- How much the invoice is for, what portion of the invoice is tax or discounts, and what currency the amounts are represented in.
- Who the invoice has been raised to; the _customer_.
- The breakdown of what the invoice is for; the _line items_.
- Any [payments](/datamodel-accounting-payments) assigned to the invoice; the _payment allocations_.

:::note Invoices or bills?

In Codat, invoices represent accounts receivable only. For accounts payable invoices, see [Bills](/datamodel-accounting-bills).

:::success Invoice PDF downloads

You can <a className="external" href="https://api.codat.io/swagger/index.html#/Invoices/get_companies__companyId__data_invoices__invoiceId__pdf" target="_blank">download a PDF version</a> of an invoice for supported integrations.

The filename will be invoice-{number}.pdf.

## Data model

:::note Referencing an invoice in Sage 50 and ClearBooks

In Sage 50 and ClearBooks, you may prefer to use the **invoiceNumber** to identify an invoice rather than the invoice **id**. Each time a draft invoice is submitted or printed, the draft **id** becomes void and a submitted invoice with a new **id** exists in its place. In both platforms, the **invoiceNumber** should remain the same.

:::caution Requirements for reference fields

The reference fields **customerRef**, **accountRef**, and **taxRateRef** are only populated if the corresponding data type has been synchronised. If you see null values for these fields, please complete a new sync for the corresponding data type. For example, sync the customers data type for [customerRef](/datamodel-accounting-referencetypes#section-customerref).
