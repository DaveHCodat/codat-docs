## Overview

A sales order represents a customer's intention to purchase goods or services from a seller and usually includes information such as the expected delivery date and shipping details. This information can be used to provide visibility on a business's expected receivables and to track sales through the full procurement process.

A sales order is typically converted to an [invoice](/datamodel-accounting-invoices) after approval.
