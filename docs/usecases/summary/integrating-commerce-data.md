Use Codat to integrate high-volume sales and payment data from PoS, eCommerce, and payments platforms into your SMBs' accounting platforms automatically, saving them time and effort.

### How Codat can help

We can support PoS system companies, eCommerce platforms, and vertical SaaS companies in their activity by leveraging our [Sync for Commerce](/accounting-api/overview) and [Commerce API] products. This helps your SMB customers avoid costly mistakes by automating sales data updates. They can understand their cash flow better thanks to the daily import of sales, and automatically reconcile payments, invoices, fees, and payouts on a daily basis to their chart of accounts.

For example, Sync for Commerce can be used to save your customers time and effort by pushing high-volume data from their PoS (corresponding to sales their SMB has generated) into their SMBs' accounting platform automatically.
