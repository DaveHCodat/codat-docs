In Codat, a company represents a business sharing access to their data. Each company can have multiple data connections to different data sources. For example, a business can have one connection to Xero for accounting data and a connection to Plaid for Open banking data.

With Sync for Expenses each company will have two data connections:

- One will be to their accounting platform
- The other will be to the partner expense integration
  Set up a company using API

1. Create a company.
2. Add data connections:
   - To the SMB’s accounting platform
   - To the `partner expense` integration (`rvez`)
3. Authorize the connection using the Link URL from the company’s data.

Set up a company using the Portal:

1. Create a company
2. Add data connections and authorize using Link.
