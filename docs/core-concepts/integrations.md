In Codat, an integration represents a third-party data source that you can connect a [company](/core-companies) to (using a [data connection](/core-dataconnections)) so that you can access that company's business data.

We currently support four types of integration, each enabling access to different types of business data: [accounting](/accounting/overview), [banking](/banking/overview), [commerce](/commerce/overview) integrations, and file upload integrations.

## Accounting

Codat’s [accounting integrations](/accounting/overview) allow you to easily pull up-to-date accounting data from your customers' accounting software as well as push data to their software using Codat's standard [accounting data model](/datamodel-accounting).

## Banking

Codat’s [banking integrations](/banking/overview) allow you to easily pull up-to-date account and transaction data from your customers' banks using Codat's standard [banking data model](/data-model-banking).

## Commerce

Codat’s [commerce integrations](/commerce/overview) allow you to easily pull up-to-date ecommerce, payment and point-of-sale data from your customers' commerce software using Codat's standard [commerce data model](/datamodel-commerce).

## File upload

Codat's [file upload integrations](/file-upload-integrations) allow your customers to share any documentation you require them to provide. This may include personal identity documents, pitch decks, contracts, or files with accounting and banking data.
