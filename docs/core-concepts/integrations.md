In Codat, an integration represents a third-party data source that you can connect a [company](/core-concepts/companies) to (using a [data connection](/core-concepts/connections)) so that you can access that company's business data.

We currently support four types of integration, each enabling access to different types of business data: [accounting](/accounting-api/overview), [banking](/banking-api/overview), [commerce](/commerce-api/overview) integrations, and file upload integrations.

## Banking

Codat’s [banking integrations](/banking-api/overview) allow you to easily pull up-to-date account and transaction data from your customers' banks using Codat's standard [banking data model](/data-model/banking).
