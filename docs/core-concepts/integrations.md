In Codat, an integration represents a third-party data source that you can connect a [company](https://docs.codat.io/docs/core-companies) to (using a [data connection](https://docs.codat.io/docs/core-dataconnections)) so that you can access that company's business data.

We currently support four types of integration, each enabling access to different types of business data: [accounting](https://docs.codat.io/docs/accounting-overview), [banking](https://docs.codat.io/docs/banking-overview), [commerce](https://docs.codat.io/docs/commerce-overview) integrations, and file upload integrations.

## Accounting

Codat’s [accounting integrations](https://docs.codat.io/docs/accounting-overview) allow you to easily pull up-to-date accounting data from your customers' accounting software as well as push data to their software using Codat's standard [accounting data model](https://docs.codat.io/docs/datamodel-accounting).

## Banking

Codat’s [banking integrations](https://docs.codat.io/docs/banking-overview) allow you to easily pull up-to-date account and transaction data from your customers' banks using Codat's standard [banking data model](https://docs.codat.io/docs/data-model-banking).

## Commerce

Codat’s [commerce integrations](https://docs.codat.io/docs/commerce-overview) allow you to easily pull up-to-date ecommerce, payment and point-of-sale data from your customers' commerce software using Codat's standard [commerce data model](https://docs.codat.io/docs/datamodel-commerce).

## File upload

Codat's [file upload integrations](https://docs.codat.io/docs/file-upload-integrations) allow your customers to share any documentation you require them to provide. This may include personal identity documents, pitch decks, contracts, or files with accounting and banking data.
