All Codat accounts come with access to our Sandbox integration and it should be enabled by default.

If you've disabled your Sandbox integration and you need to re-enable it, you should:

1. Sign in to the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io).
2. On the navigation bar, select **SettingsÂ > Integrations > Accounting**.
3. Find the **Sandbox** integration then use the toggle to update it from **Disabled** to **Enabled**.
