The Codat Sandbox integration contains sample data for developers to test our integrations and develop product demos. Sandbox gives you access to all the data types and operations supported by Codat.

We've tried to make our Sandbox data as varied as possible; however, the data is auto-generated and its completeness and accuracy can't be guaranteed.

## Data type coverage

View the coverage of our Sandbox integration in the <a className="external" href="https://knowledge.codat.io/supported-features/accounting?view=tab-by-integration&integrationKey=mqjo" target="_blank">Data coverage explorer</a>.

## Set up the integration

See [Set up Codat Sandbox](/integrations/accounting/accounting-sandbox-setup) to learn how to set up and enable the integration.
