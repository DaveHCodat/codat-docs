To become a Lending App Partner you must:

- Implement "lending write-back", as described below.
- Set up a Commercial Agreement with Xero.
- Comply with all the relevant Certification Checkpoints.

If possible, we recommend progressing both the commercial and technical aspects of App Partnership in parallel to avoid unnecessary delays.

### Lending write-back

Xero has one unique technical requirement for lenders. 

The goal of the write back is to maintain the financial position in Xero for the customer at any point of the lending cycle. This will be achieved by recording the loan liability, the interest and/or fees, repayments, and facilitating the reconciliation of bank accounts.

[You can read Xero’s developer documentation on write-back here](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/how-to-guides/general-lending-integration-guide/). 

:::info Work closely with your account team

We recommend that you work closely with your Codat account team to implement write-back for detailed guidance specific to the type of lending you do.
