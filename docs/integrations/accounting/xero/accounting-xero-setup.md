In this guide, we'll show you how to quickly set up our Xero API integration and start accessing accounting data from your SMB customers who use Xero.

When you've completed this guide, you can use the Xero integration to connect up to 25 companies. If you want to connect more than 25 companies, you need to [register with Xero as an official Xero App Partner](/integrations/accounting/xero/xero-app-partner-program).

:::tip Tell us about your use case
Xero App Partnership is not possible for all use cases. We encourage you to work closely with Codat for guidance on your specific use case.

ðŸš€ **Steps to set up the Xero integration:**

- Retrieve your app's secure keys
- Add the app's secure keys to the Codat Portal

## Create a Xero app and configure the redirect URI

1. Log in to the [Xero Developer portal](https://developer.xero.com/) using your Xero credentials.

2. Select the **My Apps** tab.
2. Click the **New app** button at the top right.
3. Enter the following information in the **Add a new app** window:
   - **App name**: Enter a name for your application. This will be displayed to your users when they share their accounting data in your auth flow, so choose a name that clearly identifies your organization.
   - **Integration type**: Select **Web app**.
   - **Company or application URL**: Enter the URL for your company's website prefixed with `https://`
   - **Redirect URI**: Enter `https://xero.codat.io/oauth2/callback`

## Retrieve your app's secure keys

You'll need to retrieve your app's secure keys&mdash;the client ID and client secret&mdash;from the Xero Developer portal.

1. Select the **My Apps** tab and then select your app.
2. Select **Configuration** in the left pane.
3. Click the eye icon to reveal your app's **Client id**.
4. Click **Generate a secret** to generate a client secret for your app. The secret appears in the **Client secret 1** box.
   :::danger Keep the client secret safe!
   Copy the client secret for your app and store it in a safe place. If you leave the **Configuration** page for your app, you won't be able to view the client secret again and will need to generate a new one.
   :::
5. Keep the **Configuration** page open in your browser. You'll need to enter your secure keys in the next procedure.

## Add your Xero app's secure keys to the Codat Portal

Next, add the secure keys for your Xero application to the Codat Portal.

1. In the Codat Portal, navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Accounting** to view the [**Accounting integrations**](https://app.codat.io/settings/integrations/accounting) page.
2. Locate **Xero** and click **Set up**.
3. Under **Integration settings**, enter the values for the **Client ID** and **Client secret** from your app in the Xero Developer portal. Secure keys must not contain spaces.
4. Click **Save**. A confirmation message appears if the settings were saved successfully.
5. The **Enable Xero** dialog is displayed. Select whether to enable the integration now or later.

## Enable the Xero integration

1. In the Codat Portal, go to the [**Accounting integrations**](https://app.codat.io/settings/integrations/accounting) page.
2. Locate **Xero** and select the toggle to enable the integration.

You can also click **Manage** to view the integration's settings page, and then enable the integration from there.

## Next steps

You can now use your Xero integration to connect up to 25 companies. If you want to use your integration to connect more than 25 companies you need to [register with Xero as an official Xero App Partner](/integrations/accounting/xero/xero-app-partner-program).

If you want to set up bank feeds, see the next section.

## Configure direct bank feeds

To create a direct bank feed using Xero's Bank Feeds API, you push (`POST`) [Bank Transactions](/accounting-api#/schemas/banktransactions) via the Codat API. Bank transactions must be pushed in chronological order.

To create direct bank feeds in Xero, you must have app partner status. Additionally, the Bank Feeds API must be enabled by Xero for your registered app. For more information, see the Bank Feeds API <a href="https://developer.xero.com/documentation/bank-feeds-api/overview" target="_blank">Overview</a> in the Xero Developer documentation.

Make sure you enable Bank Feeds in your Codat portal. You can do so by navigating to the **Manage** section of the portal under the **Integrations > Accounting** tab, and clicking the toggle. Save the page to validate this configuration.

If you don't have access to direct bank feeds, a 403 error is returned if you try to push bank transactions to Xero. For example:

```json Bank transactions push error - Xero
{
  "type": "invalid-organization-bank-feeds",
  "title": "Invalid Organization",
  "status": 403,
  "detail": "The organization does not support automated bank feeds."
}
```

To remove this connection limit, you must be granted _app partner_ status with Xero.
