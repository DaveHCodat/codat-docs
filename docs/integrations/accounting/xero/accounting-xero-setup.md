5. Copy the client secret for your app and store it in a secure place.
   :::caution Keep the client secret safe!
   If you leave the **Configuration** page for your app, you won't be able to view the client secret again and will need to generate a new one.
   :::
6. Keep the **Configuration** page open in your browser. You'll need to enter your secure keys in the next procedure.

## Add your Xero app's secure keys to the Codat Portal

Next, add the secure keys for your Xero application to the Codat Portal.

1. In the Codat Portal, navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Accounting** to view the [**Accounting integrations**](https://app.codat.io/settings/integrations/accounting) page.
2. Locate **Xero** and click **Set up**.
3. Under **Integration settings**, enter the values for the **Client ID** and **Client secret** from your app in the Xero Developer portal. Secure keys must not contain spaces.
4. Click **Save**. A confirmation message appears if the settings were saved successfully.
5. The **Enable Xero** dialog is displayed. Select whether to enable the integration now or later.

## Enable the Xero integration

1. In the Codat Portal, go to the [**Accounting integrations**](https://app.codat.io/settings/integrations/accounting) page.
2. Locate **Xero** and select the toggle to enable the integration.

You can also click **Manage** to view the integration's settings page, and then enable the integration from there.

## Next steps

## About Xero App Partnership

:::tip Get your app certified

Looking for a walkthrough of the app certification and listing process? We break down everything you need to know in our blog post, <a className="external" href="https://www.codat.io/blog/get-your-app-certified-on-the-xero-app-store/" target="_blank">"How to get your app certified on the Xero App store"</a>.
:::

To link more than 25 companies (excluding connections to the Xero demo company) you must become a Xero app partner.

Xero have specific requirements about who can gain app partner status and how they must build their integration. **Xero app partnership is not possible for all use cases.**

:::caution Connection limits for non-partner apps

Xero apps created by non-partners, known as _uncertified apps_, are limited to a maximum of 25 connections (excluding connections to the Xero demo company).

To remove this connection limit, you must be granted _app partner_ status with Xero. For more information, see [App Partner Overview](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/xero-app-store/app-partner-guides/overview) and [OAuth 2.0 API limits](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/oauth2/limits/#uncertified-app-limits) in the Xero Developer documentation.

:::caution Financial services providers

Financial services providers may be subject to additional commercial terms before being granted app partner status with Xero. If you are a financial services provider, we strongly recommend that you contact Xero before you start to build your integration. You can also contact your Codat sales or solutions representative to learn more about Xero app partnership.

## Configure direct bank feeds

To create a direct bank feed using Xero's Bank Feeds API, push (`POST`) [Bank Transactions](/accounting-api#/schemas/banktransactions) via the Codat API. Bank transactions must be pushed in chronological order.

### Requirements to configure direct bank feeds

To create direct bank feeds in Xero:
- You must have Xero app partner status.
- Xero must have enabled the Xero Bank Feeds API for your registered app.

You also need to enable direct bank feeds in the Codat Portal. To do so, toggle on **Enable Bank Feeds** on the Xero integration settings page.

![](/img/old/fd2290d-2022-04-28_11h09_24.png "2022-04-28_11h09_24.png")

For more information, see the Bank Feeds API [Overview](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/bank-feeds-api/overview) in the Xero Developer documentation.

If you don't have access to direct bank feeds, a 403 error is returned if you try to push bank transactions to Xero. For example:

```json Bank transactions push error - Xero
{
  "type": "invalid-organization-bank-feeds",
  "title": "Invalid Organization",
  "status": 403,
  "detail": "The organization does not support automated bank feeds."
}
```
