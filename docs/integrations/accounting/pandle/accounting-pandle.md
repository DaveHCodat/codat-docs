:::Caution Pandle Maintenance Periods
Pandle occasionally performs updates on Tuesday mornings (UK Time) that make their API temporarily unavailable. If you experience any issues fetching data from Pandle during these periods, check their [status page](http://status.pandle.com/) and queue new synchronizations when they've completed their maintenance.
