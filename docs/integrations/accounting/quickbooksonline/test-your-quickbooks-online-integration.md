title: "Test your QuickBooks Online Integration"
---

## Prerequisites

Before you can test your integration with QuickBooks online, you will need to

- Make sure you have [Set up your QuickBooks Online integration](/integrations/accounting/quickbooksonline/accounting-quickbooksonline-new-setup) and enabled the "QuickBooks Online Sandbox" integration.
- Have an Intuit developer account

## Creating your QuickBooks Online Sandbox Accounts

Intuit allows you to provision multiple sandbox accounts within QuickBooks online which you can use to test your integration. They are valid for two years, and are unique to each Intuit developer account so can be used for long term tests without fear that test data will be reset or wiped monthly.

Follow the instructions on Intuit's Developer Portal <a href="https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/sandboxes/manage-your-sandboxes" target="_blank">here</a> to create your Sandbox accounts.

You may wish to create multiple sandboxes covering different regions (U.S., UK, Canada etc.) depending on where your customers are based.
