## Overview

When testing your accounting integrations, it is important to consider checking you can connect and authorise using a demo or sandbox account before sharing with potential customers.

Codat recommends testing throughout implementation with our Sandbox account and Xero and QuickBooks online who both offering demo/sandbox accounts with no fixed trials. Other integrations may require signing up to free trials in order to test the connection, as this trial can be time limited you may want to test towards the end of your implementation or request multiple trials.

## Demo accounts

Test accounts with unlimited use and/or demo company data.

### Sandbox

[Codat's Accounting Sandbox](https://docs.codat.io/integrations/accounting/sandbox/accounting-sandbox) contains sample data generated by Codat as a tool for developer testing.

When you link to Sandbox, you are presented with different data sets to choose from. Each data set provides a different level of detail.
