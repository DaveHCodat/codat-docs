Within Codat, there are currently three main categories of integrations available.

### Accounting Data

Using the Codat Portal, you have the option to choose which accounting packages should be shown on the link site. For detailed guides please see

*   [Cloud Accounting Integrations Setup](https://docs.codat.io/integrations/all-integrations#cloud)
*   [On-premise Connector Setup](https://docs.codat.io/integrations/all-integrations#on-premise)

These are configured on the Portal by going to the Integrations menu and selecting Accounting. Here you will see a list of possible accounting integrations, the ability to toggle the integration on and as you hover over each integration the option to Manage.

These configurations are possible via the [Codat API](https://api.codat.io/swagger/index.html#/Integrations), but the Portal is recommended for ease.

### Banking Data

Using the Codat Portal, you have the option to choose which integration should be used for each banking source. To configure your banking integrations and sources see [Banking Integrations Overview](https://docs.codat.io/integrations/all-integrations#banking) to enable your integrations and select the relevant Banking Sources.

### Commerce Data

Within the Codat Portal, you also have the ability to select which commerce platforms are available on the link site.

These are configured on the Portal by going to the Integrations menu and selecting Commerce. Here you will see a list of the available commerce integrations. Further details guides on configuring these are available in the [Commerce Integrations Overview](https://docs.codat.io/integrations/all-integrations#commerce).
