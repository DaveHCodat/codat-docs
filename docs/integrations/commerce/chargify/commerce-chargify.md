  Chargify
</a> is a subscription billing management platform that enables merchants to streamline
their recurring billing and subscription payment processes.

Use Codat's Commerce API with Chargify to securely connect to, retrieve, and view your customers' recurring sales and subscription transactions.

## Data type coverage

The Chargify integration is part of the [Domain Discovery Program](https://docs.codat.io/docs/domain-discovery-program), so it doesn't yet expose any standardized commerce data types. Please contact your Account Manager or Account Executive to find out more and gain access.

## Set up the integration

See [Set up the Chargify integration](https://docs.codat.io/docs/commerce-chargify-setup) to learn how to set up and enable the integration.
