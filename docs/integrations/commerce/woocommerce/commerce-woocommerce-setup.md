Before you can pull commerce data from companies using WooCommerce, you need to set up the integration.

You'll need to:

- Log in to the <a className="external" href="https://app.codat.io/" target="_blank">Codat Portal</a>.
- Enable the WooCommerce integration.
- Check your sync settings.

## Enable the WooCommerce integration

1. On the navigation bar, select **SettingsÂ > Integrations > Commerce**.
2. Find **WooCommerce**, then select **Set up** to view the **Integration settings** page.
3. Choose what [type of access to company data](/data-sync-settings) you wish to have for this integration: one-off or continuous.
4. In the **Application Name** box, enter the name of your application to appear in WooCommerce.
5. Select **Save**.

## Enable the WooCommerce integration

1. In the Codat Portal, go to the <a className="external" href="https://app.codat.io/settings/integrations/commerce" target="blank">**Commerce integrations**</a> page.
2. Locate **WooCommerce** and click the toggle to enable the integration.

You can also click **Manage** to view the integration's settings page, and then enable the integration from there.

## Check your sync settings in the Codat Portal

If this is your first commerce integration, update your [data type settings](/integrations/commerce/commerce-sync-settings) to enable commerce data types.

You're now ready to [set up companies](/other/portal/companies#add-a-new-company) for your customers in the Codat Portal.
