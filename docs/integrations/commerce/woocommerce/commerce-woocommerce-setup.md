Before you can pull commerce data from companies using WooCommerce, you need to set up the integration.

You'll need to:

- Sign in to the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/).
- Enable the WooCommerce integration.
- Check your sync settings.

Registration with WooCommerce is not required to set up and enable the integration. 

## Enable the WooCommerce integration

1. In the Codat Portal, go to the [**Commerce integrations**](https://app.codat.io/settings/integrations/commerce) page.
2. Locate **WooCommerce**, then select **Set up** to view the **Integration settings** page.
3. Enter the **Application name** to appear in WooCommerce.
   
   The application name is displayed when a merchant links their store and is asked for permission to connect the store.

4. Choose what [type of access to company data](/core-concepts/data-type-settings) you want for this integration: one-off or continuous.
5. Click **Save**.
6. In the dialog that appears, click **Enable WooCommerce**.

You can also click **Manage** to view the integration's settings page, and then enable the integration from there.

## Check your sync settings in the Codat Portal

If this is your first commerce integration, update your [data type settings](/integrations/commerce/commerce-sync-settings) to enable commerce data types.

You're now ready to [set up companies](/other/portal/companies#add-a-new-company) for your customers in the Codat Portal.
