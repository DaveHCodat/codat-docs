## Set up the integration

See [Set up the Shopify integration](https://docs.codat.io/docs/commerce-shopify-setup) to learn how to set up and enable the integration.

## Underlying provider requirements

To use our Shopify integration, you must create a Shopify app that meets the following criteria:

- Your app must meet the [Requirements for apps in the Shopify App Store](https://shopify.dev/apps/store/requirements), as published on the Shopify Developers Platform.
- Shopify must review and approve your app, which can take up to two weeks.

Additionally, if you need to access over 60 days' of orders, you must submit a _Read all orders_ request as noted in [Create a Shopify app](https://docs.codat.io/docs/commerce-shopify-setup#create-a-shopify-app). You'll receive an email from Shopify when your request has been processed; this might take up to seven business days.

Before setting up the integration, review the preceding requirements to make sure your use case is in accordance with Shopify's Terms of Service. Codat can't guarantee that Shopify will approve your app or grant access to all order data.
