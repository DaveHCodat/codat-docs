## Data type coverage

The Chargebee integration is part of the [Domain Discovery Program](/integrations/commerce/domain-discovery-program), so it doesn't yet expose any standardized commerce data types. Please contact your Account Manager or Account Executive to find out more and gain access.

## Set up the integration

See [Set up the Chargebee integration](/integrations/commerce/chargebee/commerce-chargebee-setup) to learn how to set up and enable the integration.
