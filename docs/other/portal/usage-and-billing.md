### Dashboard

Use the dashboard on the Portal's [home page](https://app.codat.io/) for a real-time, high-level view of the following details:
- Overall number of created companies,
- Number of companies that have been active in the current billing period,
- A quantitative breakdown of the companies' connection statuses.

Active companies represent your customer connections where you have successfully pulled or pushed data within a specific billing period.

### Monitoring your usage

You can view detailed usage and billing information, including monetary amounts associated with your specific experience, by navigating to **Settings > Organization settings > Billing** in the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/settings/billing). 

The **Plans** tab provides you with a summary view of the [plan](https://www.codat.io/plans/) you are currently on, a list of your enabled products, and a preliminary billing total for the current billing period based on your usage so far. 

The **Usage** tab focuses on the active companies associated with your account and their impact on your expected billing totals. You can examine the list of companies that were active in the selected billing period, view this data in a graph form, and check how the number of active companies influences the amount of your predicted charge. You can also compare your usage and cost across periods by selecting a different _Billing range_.
