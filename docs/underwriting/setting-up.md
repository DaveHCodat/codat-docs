To begin building the underwriting demo app, make the following preparations:

Create a free Codat account

We provide a free account that lets you explore and test our APIs and other products, including Assess. It also comes equipped with a sample company. 

You will not be charged when using the account for this demo project. 

Enable data types needed for underwriting

Log in to the Codat Portal and click on the Settings tab in the top menu. Then, navigate to Integrations > Data types and make sure that balanceSheet and profitAndLoss accounting data types are set to fetch on first link. If you donâ€™t have these data types enabled, the Assess product will not work in this demo. 

Check your auth flow settings

In the Codat Portal, click on the Settings tab in the top menu. Then, navigate to Auth flow > Link. Scroll down to Integration categories and ensure Accounting integration caategory is enabled, and Sandbox integrations switch is toggled on. 

Enable the Assess product

Log in to the Codat Portal and click on the Companies tab in the top menu. Click on the company you are performing underwriting for, and navigate to Products > Assess. Then, follow the on-screen prompt to enable the product. If it is already enabled, you will be taken straight to the Assess Profit and Loss page.
