## Outcomes

In simple terms, underwriting means checking an applicant‚Äôs finances to make a decision on their loan request. 

ü•Ö With this build guide, we will explain how a lender can use Codat to automate the underwriting decision-making using our [Assess](/assess/overview) product against the end-to-end lending process. We will also guide you with a demo project, where you can see underwriting with Codat in action using our Sandbox integration data. 

‚úîÔ∏è Explore our demo project to:

- Create a test company via Codat‚Äôs API and submit an example loan application form,
- Access and fetch test financial data using Codat‚Äôs Enhanced Profit and Loss and Enhanced Balance Sheet endpoints,
- Use Codat‚Äôs webhooks to trigger the underwriting of a loan,
- Produce an automated underwriting decision based on custom financial metrics. 

‚ùå This guide does not cover: 

- Building a user interface to support the application form submissions and review of the application‚Äôs underwriting status,
- Details or recommendations of various financial metrics used in different underwriting models.

## Why use Assess

## Running the demo project

Pick up our underwriting demo repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/codatio/build-guide-underwriting-be) and clone it. 

To run the demo app, you need to have an account with Codat, enable the Assess product, and get your API key to use it in the demo app. You also need a way to access remote systems from your locally hosted server. We will take you through these steps in detail when [setting up the solution](/underwriting/setting-up).
