:::tip Who is this guide for?

Codat's build guides are for our developer users. We assume you are a developer and know how to use an API.
:::

In simple terms, underwriting means checking an applicant’s finances to make a decision on their loan request. With this build guide, we will demonstrate .... 
We also provide you with a demo project, where you can see underwriting with Codat in action. 



This project demonstrates how you can leverage Codat to automate the process of underwriting a loan application. 

[Not really this project anymore, because we now talk about a build guide with a demo in it as an example]

Work through this guide to:

- 
- 
- 

Explore our demo project to:

- Create a test company via Codat’s API and submit an example loan application form,
- Access and fetch test financial data using Codat’s enhanced Profit and Loss and enhanced Balance Sheet endpoints,
- Use Codat’s webhooks to trigger the underwriting of a loan,
- Produce an automated underwriting decision based on custom financial metrics. 

This guide does not cover: 

- Building a user interface to support the application form submissions and review of the application’s underwriting status,
- Details or recommendations of various financial metrics used in different underwriting models.

:dart: Completing this guide lets you experience the end-to-end underwriting process flow. Therefore, you will act both as an applicant and as a lender.

:hammer: The project is implemented in [.NET 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) as a backend API that uses features of Codat's [Assess](/assess/overview) product.
