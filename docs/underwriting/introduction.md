:::tip Who is this guide for?

Codat's build guides are for our developer users. We assume you are technically savvy and know how to use an API.
:::

In simple terms, underwriting means checking an applicant’s finances to make a decision on their loan request. With this build guide, we will explain how a lender can use Codat to automate the underwriting decision-making using our [Assess](/assess/overview) product against the end-to-end lending process.We also provide you with a demo project, where you can see underwriting with Codat in action. 

:dart: Completing this guide lets you experience the end-to-end underwriting process flow supported by Codat, both as an applicant and as a lender.
