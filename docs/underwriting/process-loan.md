:::note Underwriting process flow

You can review a [swimlane diagram](https://github.com/codatio/build-guide-underwriting-be#implementing-the-solution) of the underwriting process flow followed by our guide and the demo app.
:::  

üôèüèΩ <input type="checkbox" unchecked /> <b>Initiate a new loan application</b>  

When a prospective borrower starts a new loan application by calling your relevant endpoint, we expect it to return an application `id`. This is so we can use it as the company name to create a company using Codat's `POST /companies` endpoint. 

This allows us to assign the application a reference in Codat, even though we don't have the company details yet. These would be provided by the borrower at the next step. When the new company is created, the company and application `id`s are stored in Codat, and should be returned to the prospective borrower, together with a `linkUrl`.

We also advise to store the date the application was created to use as a reference date later.

   In our demo, we do not provide a UI for the loan application form. For your underwriting solution. We use an example `application/start` endpoint when a new loan application is triggered. For your business case, we recommend developing an interface to enable form submission and status review.

üôèüèΩ <input type="checkbox" unchecked /> <b>Provide application details</b>  

The borrower uses the application `id` returned to them to complete the application form. If the details provided are valid, they are stored against the application `id` with an acknowledgement of their receipt. 

:::tip Demo app: loan application

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Starting an application" label="Starting an application">
    In our demo, we request the borrower's full name, company name, and the loan amount, length, and purpose. These details are posted to the `applications/forms` endpoint, which validates that the required fields exist and are within acceptable limits.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Example form" label="Example form">  

    Application form values proposed in our demo:
    ```json
        {
        "id": "applicationId", 
        "companyName": "Example Company",
        "fullName": "John Smith",
        "loanAmount": 25000.00, // must be greater than zero 
        "loanTerm": 36, // must be at least 12 months
        "loanPurpose": "Growth marketing campaign"
        }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
:::

üôèüèΩ <input type="checkbox" unchecked /> <b>Provide financial data</b>  

Next, the borrower also needs to provide Codat access to their accounting platform so that we can fetch the data required to underwrite their application. 

To enable this, share the `linkUrl` returned by our `POST /companies` endpoint with the borrower. They should navigate to the link, follow the flow built using our [Link feature](/auth-flow/overview), and select a platform that is the source of their accounting data. 

You can [customize](/auth-flow/customize/customize-link) the applicant's authorization journey to suit your business needs, including branding, redirects, and available connections. You can also choose between our [Hosted](/auth-flow/authorize-hosted-link) and [Embedded](/auth-flow/authorize-embedded-link) solutions.

:::tip Demo app: linking an accounting platform

In the demo project, we expect you to select the **Codat Sandbox** as the source of accounting data. You can authorize this connection without entering any credentials. You should also skip the step of uploading business documents.

üôèüèΩüí∞ <input type="checkbox" unchecked /> <b>Check the progress of the loan</b>  

The borrower and lender should be able to check the loan status anytime. In our demo, this can be done by calling the `GET applications/{applicationId}`. 

You can use the webhooks previously set up to track the progress of the application. 

We can only assess the application and provide an outcome once the data requirements for the underwriting model are complete. The loan request is then automatically updated with an _Accepted_ or _Rejected_ status to indicate the decision made on the loan, or with an _UnderwritingFailure_ status to cater for programmatic errors.

:::tip Demo app: data requirements

The underwriting model we use in the demo requires the following data about the company and the borrower:

- Validated application details
- Chart of accounts
- Balance sheet
- Profit and loss statement
- Classified accounts

:::

üí∞ <input type="checkbox" unchecked /> <b>Manually categorize accounts</b>   

While Codat‚Äôs Assess product is able to automatically categorize most of the source chart of accounts accounts, it is not always possible, and a manual intervention may be required. 

To do that, the underwriting analyst needs to log in to the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/) and click on the **Companies** tab in the top menu. Next, click on the company they are performing underwriting for, and navigate to **Products > Assess**. The red **Categorization required** button to the right of the company name indicates there are uncategorized accounts in the chart. 

Clicking the button takes the analyst to the **Account categorization** page which displays a list of all the uncategorized accounts. They can select the **Account type**, **Account subtype**, and **Account detail** from drop down lists. Once this is done, they can **Save** the categorization. This enables the underwriting process to continue.


:::tip Demo app: account categorization

In our demo, when accounts are pulled from Codat's Accounting Sandbox and categorized, one account remains without a specified category. You need to assign a category to it before the demo application is ready for underwriting. This is because the Profit and Loss, and Balance Sheet data types in Assess depend on fully categorized accounts.
