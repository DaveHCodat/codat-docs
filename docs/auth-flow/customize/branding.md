Link is a white-label solution that can be matched to your company's branding. Go to [Settings > Branding](https://app.codat.io/settings/branding) in the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io) to tailor Link for a fully custom-branded experience.

Note that this page autosaves when changes are made.

### Set your company name

Your company name, as you see it in the Portal, is also displayed in Link when your customers connect their accounting platforms to Codat.

### Set your company logo

This logo appears in the navigation bar of Link, and on the [on-premise connector](/offline-connectors) screens when users link on-premise applications.

Use PNG, JPEG, SVG, or GIF file formats and ensure the file size does not exceed 10MB. Recommended dimensions for the company logo are 600px x 100px.

### Set a company icon

This icon (uploaded as a favicon) appears as the Link browser tab icon and on the [on-premise connectors'](/offline-connectors) system tray icon.

Use ICO file format and ensure the file size does not exceed 500KB. Recommended dimensions for the company icon are 32px x 32px.

### Set your brand colors

You can set your brand's primary color to define the color of buttons and other elements within Link and Sync Flow.
