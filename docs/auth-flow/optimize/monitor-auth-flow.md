In the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/monitor/auth-flow-overview), we provide you with an opportunity to monitor your customers' authorization actions so you can gain insight about your auth flow and optimize it where necessary. This monitoring is performed across all enabled integration types.

Navigate to **Monitor > Auth flow > Overview** to discover the overall percentage of your customers that have authorized the integration connections and the overall percentage of companies that uploaded a file as part of their auth process. 

Analyze the auth funnel to see how many customers completed their authorization journey in contrast to the quantity of those who started the Link flow and those who began the auth process. 

Finally, visualize your stats of auth flow completion using the graph. It represents the ratio of the number of commpleted auth journeys to the number of started auth flows within a given week, expressed as a percentage. 

Note that the monitor starts producing the auth flow completion chart only when a non-zero number of auth flows is completed in a given week. As a result, initial weeks of use may not appear if no journeys have been completed.
