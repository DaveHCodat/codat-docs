Once you have [signed up for your account](/creating-your-account), you will be able to sign in to the <a href="https://app.codat.io" target="_blank">Codat Portal</a>.

Once logged in, you can configure your settings and integrations, create companies and view company data, view information about your account, and access any Codat products you have configured.

The Portal is powered by the Codat API, which means that its functionality is also available if you use the API directly.
