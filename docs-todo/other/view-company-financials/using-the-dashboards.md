:::note Request access to company financials

Contact your sales representative to view all financial dashboards. Currently only accounting data types are supported.
:::

Company financials are generated from a standard set of Codat's data types. Without this standard data, certain parts of these financial dashboards will be unavailable.

This article explains how to set up and use company financials for the first time, including how to:

- Make sure that the correct data types are enabled in your sync settings.
- Open the company overview.
- Verify a company (optional).
- Make sure all data is available.
- Drilldown into more detailed data.

For detailed descriptions of the data displayed in the dashboard and options for updating the data displayed, see the other pages in this section.

## Update your data type settings

Update your configuration to sync the data types that are required to build the company financials. You only need to do this once for all companies.

1. Open the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io).
2. Select the **Settings** tab and click on _Data types_ in the left hand navigation.
3. Set the **Fetch on first link** toggle to **On** on the following data types:

- **Balance Sheet**
- **Bill Credit Notes**
- **Bill Payments**
- **Bills**
- **Company**
- **Credit Notes**
- **Customers**
- **Invoices**
- **Payments**
- **Profit and Loss**
- **Suppliers**

4. Choose a _Sync frequency_ for each data type.
5. Select _Save Changes_ to update your configuration.

## Open the company overview

A company overview is available for every company that uses [accounting data types](https://docs.codat.io/docs/accounting-data-types) and has successfully synced their data.

1. In the Codat portal, in the navigation bar, select **Companies**.
2. Find the company you're interested in and select **View Data**.
3. At the top of the company page, select **Visualise**. The **Companies House** dialog box is displayed.

## Verify a company (optional)

All company details are cross-referenced against publicly-held data at Companies House. You can either link your company to the correct details, or skip this part of the process.

In the **Companies House** dialog box, either:

- Select one of the close matches to the company name that are listed in the **Companies House **dialog box and then select **Connect**.
- Select **Don't see your company?** to search for the company details.
- Select **Skip**.

## Check data availability

Before you start to use the company overview and other financial dashboards, make sure all data types have been synced.

1. If a **Data Unavailable** message is displayed in any of the dashboard sections, select **Refresh Data** and wait for the data to synchronise.
2. If data is still missing, select **Back to Company** and then **View datasets** to troubleshoot any issues with syncing data.

## Drilldown into more detailed data

From the company overview, you can drilldown into more detailed data in a number of ways.
