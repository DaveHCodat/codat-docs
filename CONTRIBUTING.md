## Development Workflow

In order to run the documentation locally, install the dependencies and run the development server:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

We recommend npm -v 8+ and Node.js -v 16+.

## Project Structure

The Codat docs are built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Content written primarily in Markdown, though React JSX is also valid.

## Reporting Issues

Before submitting an issue to the Codat docs repo, please search [existing issues](https://github.com/codatio/codat-docs/issues) to avoid duplicate reports.

If the issue you're reporting is a bug, please be sure it is an issue with the Codat docs themselves and not the subject of the documentation. With your report, please provide:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- OS and browser versions
- If possible, a demo repo or CodePen/CodeSandbox

> **Note**: Some [reference content](#reference-content) is pulled from other Codat repos. In that case, please submit your issue on the docs repo with a link to the repo where the content lives.

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting pull requests, please keep the scope of your change contained to a single feature or bug. When in doubt, err on the side of smaller pull requests. If your pull request is a new feature, we would recommend opening an issue first to come to an agreement about the feature before putting in significant time.
